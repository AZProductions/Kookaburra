## Description
**Kookaburra** is a simple programming language. With Kookaburra you can choose between the powerful **CLI**, or start **coding** with its intuitive syntax. The syntax is simple and efficient. Create apps/games and more that are fine-tuned to perfection. Kookaburra is completely **free** to use, with local files and no data/telemetry collection. Our aim is to power creativity and inspire young developers. That's why we care about privacy and safety. We love hearing feedback to improve Kookaburra.
