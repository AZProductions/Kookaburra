  <summary>Why would you downloads Kookaburra?</summary>
 
 Kookaburra is a simple programming language, designed for beginners but with sufficient complexity for more advanced coders. Kookaburra can be run on multiple platforms all using the same structure and syntax, thereby requiring a only single learning curve.
 
 It's completely free and open-source. It leaves no footprint with all data stored in a single directory. It simply creates a folder in the **AppData Roaming** folder. You can have a look in the folder by pressing <kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and typing **'%appdata%/kookaburra'**. Press *enter*, file explorer will appear with the open folder.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Will Kookaburra ever support Mac-OS?</summary>
 
 We currently see no demand in Mac-OS, unless it's worth the time in testing Kookaburra. You can always make your own build of Kookaburra that supports Mac-OS. Some features need modifications to work.
 
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Does Kookaburra support custom commands?</summary>
 
 **Yes**, it does. Open the Kookaburra config directory, and edit the ```custom_commands.txt``` file. Kookaburra is made in a dynamic workflow, any improvements and suggestions greatfully received. 
 
 You can add a new line with ```paint=mspaint```. When typing the command **paint**, it will open *Microsoft Paint*. [Read more..](https://github.com/AZProductions/Kookaburra/blob/main/resources/The%20complete%20guide%20of%20Kookaburra.md)

## üîê Security
When downloading Kookaburra, you can chose between getting it from the Microsoft Store or downloading it via GitHub. On Linux you can download it via GitHub using [***Curl***](https://curl.se/) or [***Wget***](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). On Windows open your favourite browser and head over to 'https://www.github.com/AZProductions/Kookaburra/releases' or 'https://www.github.com/AZProductions/Kookaburra/releases/latest' to download the latest stable build. Click on the little dropdown icon and download the most suitable version for your computer. 

**If you don't know which version you should download, newer computers support x64. If you have an older computer or don't know if the computer is x64 based, just pick the x86 version.**

Some browsers like Edge will stop you from opening the file. These pop ups are just warnings to tell the user to not download random files off the internet. The official Kookaburra files are safe to use. Feel free to use an antivirus program to check for your own piece of mind. Just select **keep** and open the file. Windows *SmartScreen* will pop up, and again, this is a false positive. Click on *Read more*, and select run. Kookaburra should start up. If you're not so keen with these pop ups, we recommend you to download it in the [**Microsoft Store**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kookaburra/9pcq0dhdtzpm). *You can also manually build the code using **.Net**, it takes longer but then you can verify that the binaries haven't been tampered with.*

You can also get the SHA-256 from the file and compare it with the reference in the Releases tab in github. There's an [online tool](https://md5file.com/calculator) where you can upload the file and get the SHA-256.
