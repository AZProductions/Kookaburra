-----
##### **In this blog, were going to talk about the new improvments in Kookaburra.**
###### ***24 June 2021 - Blog 1 - Kookaburra 0.6.0***
-----

In Celebration of 100 downloads, we achived to speed up the preformace quite a bit. Here's a graph. We achived this by refactoring a lot of code, which took a long time. The idea to refactor Kookaburra started at the beginning of version **0.5.0**. Luckaly we achived the goal, and succesfully managed to speed thing up. [Get your copy of Kookaburra **0.6.0**.](https://github.com/AZProductions/Kookaburra/releases/latest) At the time of writing were still in ***Pre-2***, but were going to release it very soon. **Happy coding!**
