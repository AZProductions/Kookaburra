Currently Kookaburra doesn't support publishing to a single exe file. That has a big impact when distributing scripts. Luckily there are a few methods to bypass this inconvinicence. In this blog were only going to use the programming language [**C#**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/), but you can try to follow along with different frameworks. 

**Happy coding!**
