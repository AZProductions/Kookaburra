# Kookaburra on the Microsoft Store.
-----
##### **In this blog, we're going to talk about the experience of publishing Kookaburra to the Microsoft Store.**
###### ***24 June 2021 - Blog 1 - Kookaburra 0.6.0***
-----

In Celebration of 100 downloads, we also published Kookaburra to the Microsoft Store! The system is pretty straight forward, I rate the full experience a 9/10. The support team was kind and fast, and the overall system was polished and well-thought-out. So grab your copy for free at the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9pcq0dhdtzpm). **Note: Beta/Pre-releases will still be only for the GitHub page, to prevent people from getting new bugs.** So thank you for making the possible! **Happy coding!**
