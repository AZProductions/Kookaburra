If you have never coded before, it can be challenging. That's why we've created this simple tutorial. Let's start by creating a hello world program. This program will contain user-input and more!

        - **Note, Windows asks: **'If you change the file extension it may become unusable'**.** 
        - **Proceed to click on yes, nothing will happen if you click no.**

- Start by creating a **.kookaburra** file.
- - Create or open a new folder, we can call it **'Hello World'**. Then create a new file by left-clicking and selecting **New --> Text document**. Rename the text document to **HelloWorld.kookaburra**. 
- We can start off by printing **'hello'** to the screen. To do that, open the **.kookaburra** in ***Notepad*** or any onther text/code edeting program.
    - Start off by copy/pasting this code:
    ```
    print "hello"
    app.read()
    ```
    `print`, prints the text to the screen. And `app.read()` freezes the program until the user presses enter.
