Print Description Prints the specified message to the screen, commonly a string. Usage By default prints data as a single line, use @ to create multiple lines. Examples print \"value\" - Output 'value'. print 'string' print @\"value\" - Output the data printed before with 'value'. print @'string' wait Description Pauses the program for a specific time. Usage After wait , specify the time of milliseconds to pause the program. Examples wait 4000 - Waits 4 seconds. wait 10000 - Waits 10 seconds. app.title Description Changes the title of the application. Usage app.title = string Examples app.title = \"hello\" - Sets the window title to the text 'hello'. app.title = example - Sets the window title to the present value of the string called example. app.color Description Changes the foreground color of the console. Usage app.color = color Examples app.color = blue print \"Blue\" app.color = red print \"Red\" app.color = green print \"Green\" app.color = yellow print \"Yellow\" app.color = white print \"white\" app.read() Description Pauses the program until the user presses the 'enter' key. Usage app.read() or string example = app.read() filewriter import FileIO Description Writes data to files. Usage import FileIO new filewriter(location, value) Examples new filewriter(\"C:/users/AZ/Desktop/example.txt\", \"Hello World.\") - Writes the data 'Hello World.' to the file 'example.txt'. app.debug-off Description Removes debug text. Usage app.debug-off at the first line of the .kookabura file. start Description Starts executable or file. Usage After start , type the location of the file. This is the only function that disobeys the rules about formatting a string.

In this blog, we're going to discuss different methods to publish Kookaburra. 26 June 2021 - Blog 2 - Kookaburra 0.6.0 Currently, Kookaburra doesn't support publishing to a single exe file. That has a big impact when distributing scripts. Luckily, there are a few methods to bypass this inconvenience. In this blog we're only going to use the programming language C# , but you can try to follow along with different frameworks. 1. Idea To work around the issue of publishing Kookaburra, we can bundle both the file and the Kookaburra framework. When running the program, it will extract both Kookaburra and the file into a folder. Which is included in the exe , and run Kookaburra with the script. 2. Coding In this tutorial we are going to use Visual Studio 2019 and .Net 5 . Start off by creating a new Console Application. Then add the KookaburraShell.exe and script in resources. Remember to set Copy to output directory to Copy Always . Then copy-paste the following code. string path = System . Reflection . Assembly . GetExecutingAssembly (). Location . Replace ( \"TestApp.dll\" , \"\" ); try { Directory . CreateDirectory ( path + \"TestApp/\" ); File . Copy ( @\"Resources\\KookaburraShell.exe\" , path + \"TestApp/src.exe\" ); File . Copy ( @\"Resources\\TestApp.kookaburra\" , path + \"TestApp/TestApp.kookaburra\" ); } catch { } ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo (); startInfo . FileName = path + \"TestApp/src.exe\" ; startInfo . Arguments = path + \"TestApp/TestApp.kookaburra\" ; Process . Start ( startInfo ); You can replace TestApp with the name of your program. Using this method you can manipulate Kookaburra and add Icons and more. Publish the app by clicking Publish in the Solution Explorer . Now you can distribute your favourite program to whoever you want.
