Print Description Prints the specified message to the screen, commonly a string. Usage By default prints data as a single line, use @ to create multiple lines. Examples print \"value\" - Output 'value'. print 'string' print @\"value\" - Output the data printed before with 'value'. print @'string' wait Description Pauses the program for a specific time. Usage After wait , specify the time of milliseconds to pause the program. Examples wait 4000 - Waits 4 seconds. wait 10000 - Waits 10 seconds. app.title Description Changes the title of the application. Usage app.title = string Examples app.title = \"hello\" - Sets the window title to the text 'hello'. app.title = example - Sets the window title to the present value of the string called example. app.color Description Changes the foreground color of the console. Usage app.color = color Examples app.color = blue print \"Blue\" app.color = red print \"Red\" app.color = green print \"Green\" app.color = yellow print \"Yellow\" app.color = white print \"white\" app.read() Description Pauses the program until the user presses the 'enter' key. Usage app.read() or string example = app.read() filewriter import FileIO Description Writes data to files. Usage import FileIO new filewriter(location, value) Examples new filewriter(\"C:/users/AZ/Desktop/example.txt\", \"Hello World.\") - Writes the data 'Hello World.' to the file 'example.txt'. app.debug-off Description Removes debug text. Usage app.debug-off at the first line of the .kookabura file. start Description Starts executable or file. Usage After start , type the location of the file. This is the only function that disobeys the rules about formatting a string.
