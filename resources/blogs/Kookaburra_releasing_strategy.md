# Kookaburra's releasing strategy.
-----
##### **In this blog, we're going to talk about the new releaseing system.**
###### ***16 July 2021 - Blog 4 - Kookaburra 0.7.1***
-----

Our new releasing strategy is simple. Create a preview, release an LTR ***(long term release)***, add more features to the preview. Finaly we release the Master or Final version. This is the system we thought of, if you have any questions let us know in the [issues section in Github](https://github.com/AZProductions/Kookaburra/issues). **Happy coding!**
