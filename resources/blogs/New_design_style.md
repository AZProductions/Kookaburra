Kookaburra's design has changed to a more playfull style. Smaller gradients for better viewing options when the images are compressed. Were adapting the icons/banners to the [*material design* docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Were open for suggestions, simply create a new [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/AZProductions/Kookaburra/issues/new). **Happy Coding.**
